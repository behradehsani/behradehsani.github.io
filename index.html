<h2>üåü About Me</h2>
<p>
  As an attorney-at-law and independent researcher, I believe our thoughts, words, and actions reflect the values we consciously choose. Every decision is a reflection of our identity and helps shape our professional and personal character.
</p>
<p>
  In my professional journey, I have remained committed to justice, honesty, and truth-seeking. I believe that with kindness, empathy, and a positive perspective, we can make both the legal profession and society more humane and fair.
